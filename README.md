# Botify
A very simple Spotify API wrapper I created as a way to practice Object-oriented programming and restful APIs

I plan to make this available to download in npm once I add more endpoints.

## Library Structure

### Naming Conventions
The endpoints and their methods are named in alignment to the API documentation

### Endpoints
```
Botify.Tracks
Botify.Search
```
